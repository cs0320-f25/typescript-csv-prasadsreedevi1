# Sprint 1: TypeScript CSV

### Task C: Proposing Enhancement

- #### Step 1: Brainstorm on your own.

- #### Step 2: Use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

- #### Step 3: use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

    Include a list of the top 4 enhancements or edge cases you think are most valuable to explore in the next week’s sprint. Label them clearly by category (extensibility vs. functionality), and include whether they came from you, the LLM, or both. Describe these using the User Story format—see below for a definition. 
    1) Functionality
    As a user of the application, I am able to decide whether I want to include column headers as the first row of my CSV, so I can provide more context on the data in the CSV.
    Acceptance Criteria:
        - The user can either include a header row, or not
        - The parser doesn't return the header row as an object if it is included

    2) Extensibility
    As a user of the application, I want to ensure my input is valid before parsing, so I can avoid errors during parsing.
    Acceptance Criteria:
        -The user receives an informative message if their input is ill-formatted
        -The parser is only run upon success after validation

    Include your notes from above: what were your initial ideas, what did the LLM suggest, and how did the results differ by prompt? What resonated with you, and what didn’t? (3-5 sentences.) 

    The first idea and second were my initial ones, and the LLM suggested it as well.
